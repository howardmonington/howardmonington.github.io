# Data science portfolio by Luke Monington

This portfolio is a compilation of AI notebooks which I wrote in order to explore machine learning and deep learning.

### Temperature Regulator - Reinforcement Learning
One of the problems in my current apartment is that the shower temperature fluctuates frequently. Especially 
if someone flushes the toilet. In this project, I wanted to simulate the fluctuating shower environment and 
see if I could build a reinforcement learning model with TensorFlow in order to keep the temperature within 
the desired range. To do this, I built a Sequential Neural Network and used a DQNAgent with a BoltzmannQPolicy.
