# Data science portfolio by Luke Monington

This portfolio is a compilation of AI notebooks which I wrote in order to explore machine learning and deep learning.

## Stand-alone projects.

### Temperature Regulator - Reinforcement Learning
One of the problems in my current apartment is that the shower temperature fluctuates frequently. Especially 
if someone flushes the toilet. In this project, I wanted to simulate the fluctuating shower environment and 
see if I could build a reinforcement learning model with TensorFlow in order to keep the temperature within 
the desired range. To do this, I built a Sequential Neural Network and used a DQNAgent with a BoltzmannQPolicy.

### Landscape Recognition - CNN / Transfer Learning
Image recognition using deep learning is a driving force behind many of today's AI advancements. The purpose 
of this project is to use deep learning in order to train a neural network to classify different types of 
landscape within images. The categories are: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. 
I first did this by building my own Convolutional Neural Network using MaxPooling2D and Dropout. 
Then, I used transfer learning with the ResNet50V2 architecture to improve on those results.

### Yelp Reviews - NLP Binary Classifier
In this project, I worked with the Yelp Reviews dataset, which contains over 7 million reviews. The purpose of this project 
is to use NLP to classify these Yelp reviews into positive reviews (4-5 stars) and negative reviews (1-2 stars). To do this, 
I experimented with a Conv1D NN Architecture and a Bidirectional LSTM NN Architecture. In the end, I found that the Conv1D 
NN Architecture achieved nearly the same results, but with a drastically lower training time.
